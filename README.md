>>grades.js

It prompts the user to enter their marks (a number between 0 and 100) through the command line.
It validates the user input to ensure it's a valid number within the specified range.
It then determines the student's grade based on the following grade boundaries:
A: 80-100
B: 60-79
C: 50-59
D: 40-49
E: 0-39
Finally, it displays the calculated grade to the user.

>>speed.js

It defines a constant carSpeed with a value of 160, representing the car's speed (you can change this value for testing).
The calculateDemeritPoints function takes the car's speed as an argument.
It checks if the car's speed is within the speed limit (70 km/h). If the speed is within the limit, it displays "Ok" to indicate that the car is not speeding.
If the car's speed exceeds the limit, it calculates the demerit points based on the difference between the actual speed and the speed limit. It uses a rate of 5 km/h per demerit point.
If the calculated demerit points are equal to or greater than 12, it displays "License suspended" to indicate that the driver's license should be suspended.
Otherwise, it displays the number of demerit points acquired with the message "Points: [number]."

>>salary.js

It uses the readline module to get user inputs for basic salary and benefits through the command line.
It calculates the gross salary by adding the basic salary and benefits.
It calculates the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax (payee) based on the gross salary and tax rate tiers.
It calculates NHIF deductions based on the gross salary and NHIF rate tiers.
It calculates NSSF deductions based on the gross salary and the NSSF rate.
Finally, it computes the net salary by subtracting payee, NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions from the gross salary and displays the result.
